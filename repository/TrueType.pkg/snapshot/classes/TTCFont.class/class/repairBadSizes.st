repairBadSizes
	"There was a bug that would cause the TTCFonts to generate incorrectly sized glyphs.
	By looking at the dimensions of cached forms,
	we can tell whether the incorrect height logic was used.
	If it was, change the point size of the font and its derivatives.
	
	Note that this is probably pointless to call after the new code has been loaded; it's here for documentation (it should be called from the CS preamble instead)."
