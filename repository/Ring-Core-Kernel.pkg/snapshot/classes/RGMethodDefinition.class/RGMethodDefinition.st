RGMethodDefinition is a concrete representation of methods. It can be used to build browser for methods that are not in the image. It is polymorphic with CompiledMethod. 

* We can ask a RGMethodDefinition for its selector using the selector message.
Example:
	(Point>>#dist:) asRingDefinition selector
		-> #dist

We can also ask the ring object representation of its class or the Smalltalk class actually implementing the corresponding compiledMethod. 

* To access the ring class definition name, use parentName
	aRGMethodDefinition parentName
	
Example:
	(Point>>#dist:) asRingDefinition parentName
		->  #Point
		
* If you have a complete model where classes and methods are ring definition, to access the ring class definition , use parent
	aRGMethodDefinition parent
	
Example:
	aRGMethodDefinition(Point>>#dist:) parent
		->  aRGClassDefinition(Point)
		
* If you want to access the smalltalk class that contains the compiledMethod that is represented by a ringMethodDefinition, use realParent
	aRGMethodDefinition realParent
	
Example:
	(Point>>#dist:) asRingDefinition realParent
		->  Point
		

Now a RingEntityDefinition offers two APIs: one that is generic and works for all the source code entities and this is the one we just 
presented: parent, parentName and realParent. Having such interface is important to build generic tools that could manipulate 
any entities in a polymorphic way (yes no isKindOf: everywhere).

In addition, a ring method definition offers a specific interface that should only be used when you know that you are solely manipulate
specific entity such as class element: method definition, class comment, and variables. 

Here is the equivalence table

	realParent 				realClass
	parent					ringClass
	parentName			className


* The message class returns the class of the object :).

Example:
	(Point>>#dist:) asRingDefinition class
		->  RingMethodDefinition
		
* The message className returns the name of the ring class defining the reingMethodDefinition.

Example:
	(Point>>#dist:) asRingDefinition className
		->  #Point		
		
* If you have a complete model where classes and methods are ring definition, to access the ring class definition , use parent
	aRGMethodDefinition ringClass
	
Example:
	aRGMethodDefinition(Point>>#dist:) ringClass
		->  aRGClassDefinition(Point)
		
		
* If you want to access the smalltalk class that contains the compiledMethod that is represented by a ringMethodDefinition, use realClass
	aRGMethodDefinition realClass
	
Example:
	(Point>>#dist:) asRingDefinition realClass
		->  Point
