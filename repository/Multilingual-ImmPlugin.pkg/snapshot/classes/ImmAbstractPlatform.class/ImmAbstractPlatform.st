I provide an abstract interface for providing feedback needed by the OS for doing correct multilingual input/output.

Precomposition is done for countries  (Japan, Korea ) where keyboards have phonetic characters which are combined to create actual ideographic characters, which are then sent as actual key events to the application

It is a way to tell the operating system where it should display intermediate characters in certain composition modii for input methods which usually precompose characters before they are actually sent to the application. (At least for the ImmX11 usage)

From the link below, it seems to be the case for certain Asian keyboards:

(Sections "Issues of Internationalized Text Input" and "User Interaction with an Input Method" should be sufficient for a brief overview)

On Windows, the plugin is not provided in the shipped VM's, and its current whereabouts are uncertain.

On Unix, the only implemented behaviour is setting the position when over-the-spot precomposition of characters is the current mode.

In the VM, the mode is chosen to the first available valid mode returned by the X Server, so whether this is actually relevant at all depends on the X Server.!
