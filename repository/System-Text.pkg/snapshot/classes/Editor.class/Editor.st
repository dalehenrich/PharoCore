New text editors.
TextEditor provides most of the functionality that used to be in TextMorphEditor. This class is no longer a Controller!!
SmalltalkEditor has Smalltalk code specific features.
SimpleEditor provides basic functionality for single line text editing. It does not handle fonts and styles, aligning and Smalltalk utilities. It handles one single line.
