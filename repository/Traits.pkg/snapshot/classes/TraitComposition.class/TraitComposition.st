I hold a collection of trait transformations and provide important facilities to query the trait composition. For each trait in the composition clause there exists exactly one transformation in the collection.

Note, that directly manipulating the composition of a class or trait does not effect changes automatically. Use PureBehavior>>setTraitComposition: to do this. You have to make a copy of the old trait composition before changing it because only the difference between the new and the old composition is updated!!!
