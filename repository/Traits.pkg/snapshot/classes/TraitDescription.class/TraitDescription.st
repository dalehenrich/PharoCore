I add a number of facilities (most defined by traits which are also used in ClassDescription):
	Category organization for methods
	The maintenance of a ChangeSet, and logging changes on a file
	Most of the mechanism for fileOut.
	Copying of methods to other traits/classes
	Operators to create trait compositions!
