	"#correctFrom:to:with: is sent when the method source is
	manipulated during compilation (removing unused temps,
	changing selectors etc). But 	#correctFrom:to:with: operates 
	on the textMorph's text, and we may be saving an unstyled 
	copy of the text. This means that these corrections will be lost
	unless we also apply the corrections to the unstyled copy that we are saving.
		So remember the unstyled copy in unstyledAcceptText, so
	that when #correctFrom:to:with: is received we can also apply
	the correction to it"
