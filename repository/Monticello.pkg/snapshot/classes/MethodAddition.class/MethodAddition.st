I represent the addition of a method to a class.  I can produce the CompiledMethod, install it, and then notify the system that the method has been added.  This allows Monticello to implement atomic addition.  A loader can compile all classes and methods first and then install all methods only after they have been all compiled, and in a way that executes little code.ÃŸ!
