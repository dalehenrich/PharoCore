	"Answer an array of integers that make good hash table sizes.
	In each power of two, there are about five primes to choose from.
	Some primes are rejected:
	* Primes close to a power of two.
	* Primes which divide 256**k +- a, for small k and a
	* Primes which are close to dividing 1664525, the hashMultiply constant
	See Andres Valloud's hashing book, and Knuth TAOCP volume 3."
