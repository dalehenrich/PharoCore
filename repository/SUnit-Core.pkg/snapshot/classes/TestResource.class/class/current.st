current
	"This is a lazy accessor:  the assert of self isAvailable does no work unless current isNil.  However this method should normally be sent only to a resource that should already have been made available, e.g. in a test whose test case class has the resource class in its #resources, so should never be able to fail the assert.
	If the intent is indeed to access a possibly-unprepared or reset-in-earlier-test resource lazily, then preface the call of 'MyResource current' with 'MyResource availableFor: self'."
