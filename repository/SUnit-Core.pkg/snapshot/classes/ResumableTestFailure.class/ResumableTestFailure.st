A ResumableTestFailure triggers a TestFailure, but lets execution of the TestCase continue. this is useful when iterating through collections, and #assert: ing on each element. in combination with methods like testcase>>#assert:description:, this lets you run through a whole collection and note which tests pass.

here''s an example:

	

	(1 to: 30) do: [ :each |
		self assert: each odd description: each printString, ' is even' resumable: true]

for each element where #odd returns <false>, the element will be printed to the Transcript. !
