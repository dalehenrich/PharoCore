displayProgressFrom: minVal to: maxVal during: workBlock 
	"Display this string as a caption over a progress bar while workBlock is evaluated.

EXAMPLE (Select next 6 lines and Do It)
'Now here''s some Real Progress'
	displayProgressFrom: 0 to: 10
	during: [:bar |
	1 to: 10 do: [:x | bar value: x.
			(Delay forMilliseconds: 500) wait]].

HOW IT WORKS (Try this in any other language :-)
Since your code (the last 2 lines in the above example) is in a block,
this method gets control to display its heading before, and clean up 
the screen after, its execution.
The key, though, is that the block is supplied with an argument,
named 'bar' in the example, which will update the bar image every 
it is sent the message value: x, where x is in the from:to: range.
