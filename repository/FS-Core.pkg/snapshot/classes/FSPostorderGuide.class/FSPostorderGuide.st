I traverse the filesystem in depth-first post order. Given this hierarchy:

alpha
	beta
	gamma
delta
	epsilon

I would visit the nodes in the following order:  beta, gamma, alpha, epsilon, delta.

I use my work instance variable as a stack. I push messages that cause nodes to be traversed or visited, and execute them in reverse order.!
