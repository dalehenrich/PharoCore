relinquishProcessorForMicroseconds: anInteger
	"Platform specific. This primitive is used to return processor cycles to the host operating system when Pharo's idle process is running (i.e., when no other Pharo process is runnable). On some platforms, this primitive causes the entire Pharo application to sleep for approximately the given number of microseconds. No Pharo process can run while the Pharo application is sleeping, even if some external event makes it runnable. On the Macintosh, this primitive simply calls GetNextEvent() to give other applications a chance to run. On platforms without a host operating system, it does nothing. This primitive should not be used to add pauses to a Pharo process; use a Delay instead."
