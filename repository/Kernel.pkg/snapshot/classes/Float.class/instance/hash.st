hash
	"Hash is reimplemented because = is implemented. Both words of the float are used; 8 bits are removed from each end to clear most of the exponent regardless of the byte ordering. (The bitAnd:'s ensure that the intermediate results do not become a large integer.) Slower than the original version in the ratios 12:5 to 2:1 depending on values. (DNS, 11 May, 1997)"
