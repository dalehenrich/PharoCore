	"The material conditional, also known as the material implication or truth functional conditional.
	Correspond to not ... or ... and does not correspond to the English if...then... construction.
		
	 known as:
			b if a 
			a implies b
			if a then b
			b is a consequence of a
			a therefore b (but note: 'it is raining therefore it is cloudy' is implication; 'it is autumn therefore the leaves are falling' is equivalence).
		
	Here is the truth table for material implication:
	
	   p   |   q   |   p ==> q
	-------|-------|-------------
	   T   |   T   |      T
	   T   |   F   |      F
	   F   |   T   |      T
	   F   |   F   |      T
