	Initial minus sign accepted, and bases > 10 use letters A-Z.
	Imbedded radix specifiers not allowed;  use Number

	Raise an Error if there are no digits.
	If stringOrStream dos not start with a valid number description, answer 0 for backward compatibility. This is not clever and should better be changed."
