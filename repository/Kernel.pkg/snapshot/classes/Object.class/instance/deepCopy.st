deepCopy
	"Answer a copy of the receiver with its own copy of each instance variable. deepCopy does a deep copy. It should never be overridden and only be used if you want to get these very specific semantics.
It doesn't handle cycles, #veryDeepCopy does. In the future we will make it handle cycles and deprecate veryDeepCopy"
