A MetacelloConfigurationBrowser is simple tool to browse Metacello configurations published at http://www.squeaksource.com/MetaRepoForPharoXX where XX denotes different pharo versions.

MetaRepoForPharo1.0 acts as a distribution of all the packages/projects that can be loaded in Pharo1.0. 

We are sorry for the name but the source limits the length of the project name: The full name is 
MetacelloRepositoriesForPharoXX.

Metacello is a configuration language for packages. It allows one to define dependencies 
between packages as well as between complete projects. !
