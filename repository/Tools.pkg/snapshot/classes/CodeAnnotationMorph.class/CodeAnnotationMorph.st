I display code annotations that can be embedded in a browser (basic core image browser) to show useful informations about the current method or class. In order to show me in your browser, the "show annotation pane" setting must be set to true (search for 'annotation' in the setting browser). This setting is set to false by default.

The informations to show are given by CodeHolder>>annotation.
A methods annotation is built according to a list of requests which consists in a list of symbols. These symbols are interpreted by CodeHolder>>#annotationForSelector: ofClass:. See CodeHolder class >>#annotationRequests for more details about this list of requests.
By default, the author, the time stamp, the message category, the senders and implementors count and the list of change sets in which the method is referenced are shown.

Because the building of an annotation can be very time consuming (especially the implementors count),an annotation is built in background. So, I am also a good example of how a process can be used in order to build some data in background.

Instance Variables
   codeHolder: <CodeHolder>
   process: <Process>

codeHolder
   - The CodeHolder (a Browser, a MessageList ..) in which I'm embedded

process
   - The process which is building the annotation in background
