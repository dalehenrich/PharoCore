	"This covers parsing in Number>>readFrom:
	Note: In most Smalltalk dialects, the radix notation is not used for numbers
	with exponents. In Squeak, a string with radix and exponent can be parsed,
	and the exponent is always treated as base 10 (not the base indicated in the
	radix prefix). I am not sure if this is a feature, a bug, or both, but the
	Squeak behavior is documented in this test. -dtl"
