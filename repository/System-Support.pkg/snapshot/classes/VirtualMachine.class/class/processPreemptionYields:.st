processPreemptionYields: aBoolean
	"The Cog VM can be instructed not to yield on process preemption, i.e. not to put a preempted process at the back of its run queue.  By default preempting a process causes it to yield (Blue Book semantics) which can have unfortunate effects. This flag persists across snapshots, stored in the image header."
