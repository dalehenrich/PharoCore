	the given initial answer. Answer the string the user accepts.  Answer nil if the user cancels.  An
	empty string returned means that the ussr cleared the editing area and
	then hit 'accept'.  Because multiple lines are invited, we ask that the user
	use the ENTER key, or (in morphic anyway) hit the 'accept' button, to
