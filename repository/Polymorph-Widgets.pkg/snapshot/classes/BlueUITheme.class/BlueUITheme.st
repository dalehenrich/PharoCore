The theme is developed in the context of the Glamour project, and its goal is to create a look that:
- does not look like a specific operating system. In particular, the icons should be operating system agnostic, because, for example, people in Windows are confused by the red, yellow, green buttons of apple.
- uses a limited amount of colors and effects.
- is fast.
