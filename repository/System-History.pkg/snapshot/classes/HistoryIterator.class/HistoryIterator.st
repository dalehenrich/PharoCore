A HistoryIterator holds an UndoRedoGroup in order to store an history of commands with the possibility of undoing and redoing. The iterator cursor is represented by the index inst var. Index always contains the position of the command that can be currently undone. So, undo decrease index and redo increase index. When a new record is stored, then, index contains the newly added record position.
See HistoryIteratorTest for examples.
